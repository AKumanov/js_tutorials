					WHY GO WITH THE FLOW
					--------------------

In general, it's best to start with the simplest declarative, no-code tools and work your way up to code solutions.
While flows are a no-code solution, they're by no means the simplest one. Flows can be better described as visual coding-
they're declarative, but they require that you understand some programming concepts like variables and how logic works.

You have a bunch of automation tools at your disposal: formulas, validation rules, flows, processes and Apex.
You also have some more specific tools, like escalation and auto-response rules. Whether you should build a flow 
depends on what kind of business process you're trying to automate.

Flows are useful for two major use cases: [1 - behind-the-scenes automation,
					2 - guided visual experiences];

1 - Behind-the-Scenes Automation
________________________________

---> If your business process runs behind the scenes, and it should start automatically, such as when a record changes,
	you have your pick of solutions:
		- Build an autolaunched flow that specifies a record trigger in Flow Builder.
		- Build a process in Process Builder
		- Build an Apex trigger with Apex code.
	If your business process needs more complex functionality than is available in Process Builder, 
		create an autolaunched flow that specifies a trigger in Flow Builder.
 
2 - Guided Visual Experiences
________________________________

---> You may have heard several terms used interchangeably when referring to flows. As a reminder, the official terms are:
	- Salesforce Flow - the product that encompasses building, managing and running flows and processes.
	- Flow Builder - a point-and-click tool for building flows.
	- Flow - the part of SalesForce Flow that automates a business process by collecting data and doing
		something in your SalesForce org or an external system.
	In short, the SalesForce Flow product includes multiple tools One of them, Flow Builder, helps you create Flows.

					FLOW BUILDER
					------------

When you build flows, you use Flow Builder.
---> TOOLBOX - the toolbox contains the elements and resources you use to build your flow.
	- From the Elements tab, add new elements, like Screen and Create Records, to your flow.
	- From the Management tab, create resources, such as variables, stages, and choices
		Or view a list of all elements and resources that you've added to the flow.

----> CANVAS - The canvas is the working area, where you build a flow by adding elemenst.
	As you add elements to the canvas and connect them together, you see a visual diagram of your flow.

---> BUTTON BAR - the button bar provides information about the flow, such as:
	- Whether the flow is active or not
	- How long ago the flow was saved
	- Whether the flow has any warnings or errors. To see warnings and errors, click the respective icon.
	
	The button bar also includes two buttons for running a flow: Run and Debug
		- Run runs the most recent saved version of the flow that you have open.
		- Debug lets you enter values for the flow's input variables and display debug details
			while running the flow. That way, you can verify how the flow processes data.


Flow Building Blocks
________________________________

Every flow is made up of three building blocks: elements, connectors and resources.

---> Elements appear on the canvas. To add an element to the canvas, click and drag it there from the toolbox.

---> Connectors define the path that the flow takes at runtime. They tell the flow which element to execute next.
	Click and drag connectors from one element on the canvas to another.

---> Resources are container that represent a given vaule, such as field values or formulas. You can define
	You can reference resources throughout your flow. For example, look up an account's ID, store that ID
	in a variable, and later reference that ID to update the accoun.


ELEMENTS - each element is a step in the flow that instructs the flow on what to do. Those instructions vary based
	on which kind of element it is. Think of flow elements in terms of three different buckets: screens, logic and actions.

	Screens - Display data to your users or build a form to collect information from them with Screen elements.
		Screens include a treasure trove of out-of-the-box components that let you customize how users interact with your flows.
		Display text or images to your users. Request free-form responses, such as with a text box, or ask users to select
		from provided choices, such as radio buttons. You can even have the user upload a file through the screen.

	Logic - Once you collect the data you need, what do you want to do with it? With logic elements, evaluate that data and manipulate 
		it according to your business requirements. Create branches, update data, loop over sets of data, or pause until specified time.

		Logic operates only in the flow. If you use logic elements to evaluate or manipulate information in your flow, the resulting data
		can't be accessed after the flow finishes. Use an action to store that data somewhere outside the flow.

	Actions - Actions instruct the flow to do somethign of itself, such as in the SalesForce database or in an external system.
		Flows can look up, create, update and delete (CRUD) SF records. They can also create Chatter posts, submit records for approval
		and send emails.

CONNECTORS - connectors define the path that the flow takes as it runs. They tell the flow which element to execute next.

RESOURCES - Resources are placeholders that you reference throughout your flow.

Plan Out the Flow
________________________________

Now that we've learned a bit about the types of elements that flow offers, let's think back to the request. It's tempting to jump right into Flow Builder,
	but first map those requirements into a plan.

			|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
			|REQUIREMENT					|Element Type of Use|
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|Collect information from user:			|Screen		    |
			|first and last name, account for contact	|		    |
			|as well as what to do if a matching contact	|		    |
			|exists						|		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|Find a matching contact record			|Action		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|Check if a matching record was found		|Logic		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|If no match exists, create a contact		|Action		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|If a match exists, update that contact		|Action		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|For both branches, confirm what the flow	|Action		    |
			|did in Chatter					|		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
			|For both branches, confirm that the flow	|Screen		    |
			|is done					|		    |
			|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
